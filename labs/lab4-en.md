# Lab 4: Understanding and Preventing XSS Attacks

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, identify how they can be exploited in web applications, and learn the necessary steps to prevent them.

## Phase 1: Identifying XSS Vulnerabilities

### Step 0: Setup Environment
Ensure the project from the previous labs is up and running in your local environment.

### Step 1: Explore XSS Attack Vectors
Familiarize yourself with the different types of XSS attacks: Stored XSS, Reflected XSS, and DOM-based XSS. For this lab, we'll concentrate on Stored and Reflected XSS.

### Step 2: Identifying Vulnerable Points
1. Examine the code for `add-product.php` and `products.php`. Identify how user input is incorporated into the output without proper validation or encoding.
2. Create a malicious input containing JavaScript code, such as `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` or `<script>alert("XSS");</script>`, and submit it via the form on `add-product.php`.
3. Navigate to `products.php` and observe if the script executes, indicating an XSS vulnerability.

## Phase 2: Exploiting XSS Vulnerabilities

### Step 1: Craft Malicious Payload
Develop a sophisticated payload that performs an observable action, such as:

1. Altering page content (adding DOM elements): `<script>document.getElementById('').innerHTML="...";</script>`
2. Redirecting to a different website: `<script>window.location.href="...";</script>`.

### Step 2: Test the Payload
Submit your malicious payload through the `add-product.php` page and note its impact on the `products.php` page.

## Phase 3: Preventing XSS Attacks

### Step 1: Sanitize User Input
Implement input sanitization in `add-product.php` to strip or encode special characters from user inputs before processing or storing them. For this, implements prepared statements.

**Tip**: Use mysqli instead of mysql functions: 
``` PHP 
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

// Prepare and bind
$stmt = $conn->prepare("INSERT INTO product (libelle, category_id, description) VALUES (?, ?, ?)");
$stmt->bind_param("sis", $libelle, $category_id, $description);

```
### Step 2: Encode Output
Adjust `products.php` to encode special characters in the output. Utilize PHP's `htmlspecialchars()` function to safely encode user-generated content prior to display. 

### Step 3: Validate Input
Apply input validation where possible to ensure that data conforms to expected formats. For instance, verify numeric fields to confirm they contain only numbers before processing.

### Step 4: Content Security Policy (CSP)
Consider implementing a Content Security Policy as an additional security measure to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks.

## Phase 4: Testing Fixes

### Step 1: Retest with Previous Payloads
Attempt to exploit the XSS vulnerability once more using the same payloads from Phase 2 to confirm that the vulnerability has been effectively addressed.

### Step 2: Review and Understand the Fixes
Review how input sanitization, output encoding, and validation help prevent XSS vulnerabilities and secure web applications.

## Conclusion
Compose a brief report discussing the significance of preventing XSS attacks, the potential for exploitation if vulnerabilities are not mitigated, and the measures taken in this lab to address them.
